## **Oh, no, you've reached the end of the book!**

I'm still writing it. **If you want to give me encouragement, a tip of any size to **[**my PayPal**](https://www.paypal.me/morinted)** will guarantee a new page with your name on it!**

Please include a note on how you'd like to be attributed. On top of the new lesson, I'll put a name and link of your choice, or can keep you anonymous.

\(I reserve the right to veto any name or link I find inappropriate -- I want to keep the textbook family-friendly as best as possible. GitHub, Twitter, and personal websites should all be fine\)

Advanced number usage, such as -Z, -D, clock times, Roman numerals?

I want to get Jeff to make illustrations, mainly to draw the exercise sentences. I want a wet rat to be hugged.

In the later lessons I think I'll move more into a format where I have one or two "letters" or stories as opposed to just the drilling sentences.

### Topics to cover

- Capitalization
- Punctuation
- Cursor movement
